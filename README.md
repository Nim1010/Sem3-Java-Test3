This lab project focuses on building a complete JavaFX desktop application for a pizza ordering system. The application allows users to enter customer details, select pizza size, input the number of toppings, and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Contributions
I personally worked on:
Designing the JavaFX UI layout.
Writing CRUD operations using PreparedStatement.
Setting up the MySQL database structure.
Ensured the final program meets all functional and technical requirements.
Running JUnit tests for accuracy.

I used AI-generated suggestions to:
Creating model classes and DAO architecture.
Structure JUnit test coverage for corner cases.
Write and test the total bill calculation logic and its JUnit test cases.
Connecting up the MySQL database with javaFx properly.
